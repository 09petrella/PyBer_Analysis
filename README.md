# PyBer Ride Sharing Data Analysis 

## Overview of Project 

### Purpose
A continuation on our analysis of PyBer Ride Sharing data as a Data Analyst to present findings to management and provide strategy recommendations. For this assignment we used Python scripts and the Pandas library to create an overall Summary DataFrame for the ride-sharing data broken down by the city type. In addition for visual representation, using Pandas and Matplotlib we built a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Based from the results of our findings we can highlight how the data differs by the city type and how this information can be useful for management at PyBer. 

## Results 

### Analysis on PyBer Cities Data 
From reviewing the below Summary DataFrame and Total Fare by City Type Graph below, it is clearly shown there are large differences in the data across the Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types. The Total Rides and Total Drivers both show that Urban cities greatly outnumber the other two city types for these categories. Urban cities had around 2.5 times the number of rides then Suburban cities, and 13 times more than Rural cities. Similarly the Urban cities Total Drivers had a substantial amount of drivers, and Rural cities drivers were significantly less than even Suburban cities by around 6 times the amount. These volume statistics can show its effect in our Total Fares Data Category, where Urban cities doubled the amount than Suburban cities and Rural cities was far behind. From the Total Fares by City Type multiple-line graph, this showed throughout the time period Urban cities was the clear leader. The rankings are then flipped when the averages for fares per ride and driver are calculated. The Average Fare per Ride finished had closer results where Rural cities had on average around $3.50 higher than Suburban cities, and just over $10.00 more than Urban cities. For the Average Fare per Driver, the data showed a larger difference in results where Rural cities had a $16.00 higher amount than Suburban cities, and close to $39.00 more than Urban cities.

## Summary

### PyBer Recommendations 
A recommendation for the PyBer business from our analysis results is to review slightly decreasing the number of drivers in urban cities. This should help save costs while also increasing the Average fare per driver to raise its value and lessen the difference between the other city types. Another recommendation is to slightly increase the number of drivers in Rural city types. For these cities the total fares and total rides is less than the other city types, but with a slight increase in the number of drivers it can have the ride-sharing service become more available which should cut back delay times and a boost in total rides can occur. PyBer should also focus on expanding its ride sharing capacity in Suburban cities to increase revenue. With nearly five times less the number of drivers than the Urban city type, Suburban cities still produced nearly half of the total fares which Urban cities contributed.
